It defines a function planetary_atmosphere that takes in the planetary parameters (radius, mass, temperature, gravity, surface pressure, and surface altitude) as arguments and returns arrays of pressure, temperature, and density as functions of altitude.

The function initializes arrays for pressure, temperature, and density.

It sets the initial conditions for pressure, temperature, and density based on the given surface values.

It uses a loop to calculate pressure, temperature, and density at different altitudes based on the formulas you provided.

The if __name__ == "__main__": block sets the planetary parameters and then calls the planetary_atmosphere function to calculate the arrays of pressure, temperature, and density.

Finally, the code uses matplotlib to plot pressure and density against pressure, illustrating how temperature and density change with altitude.
